# TravellersRest-MoreHarvests

Increase the number of items dropped from various forms of harvesting/gathering.  Each of these is seperately configurable via the config settings.

I created this mod because I wanted to increase the amount of herbs dropped; finding the place to change herbs took a long time and I found almost every other type of harvestable resource along the way.


* Number of extra berries to generate (default: 0)
* Number of extra misc items (sticks, junk, mussels) to generate (default: 0) 
* Number of extra crops to generate on harvest (pickup only, not scythe) (default: 0)
* Number of extra tree items to generate (default: 3) 
* Number of extra herbs to generate (default: 3) 
* Number of extra rocks to generate when mining - note this is per hit, not in total. (default: 1)

# TravellersRest-MoreHarvests
Increase the number of items dropped from various methos of harvesting/gathering.  Each of these is seperately configurable via the config rule:


* Number of extra berries to generate
* Number of extra misc items (sticks, junk, mussels) to generate 
* Number of extra crops to generate on harvest (pickup only, not scythe)
* Number of extra tree items to generate 
* Number of extra herbs to generate 
* Number of extra rocks to generate when mining - note this is per hit, not in total.
